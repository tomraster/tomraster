title: The effects of bourgeois virtues on US innovation
summary: <br> -- Lars Harhoff Andersen (U Copenhagen), <u>Tom Raster</u> <br> <i>Work in progress</i> <br> <br> Praising hard work, risk-taking, and wealth accumulation, so-called bourgeois virtues, are hypothesized drivers of innovation and growth (McCloskey, 2006, 2010, 2016). We test this claim, devising a new first-name-based measure of bourgeois virtues and leveraging quasi-exogenous exposure to the bourgeoisie that is provided by road trips of Henry Ford and Thomas Edison ("The Vagabonds") across the US (1914-24). Using variations in the timing of the road trips and the counties Ford and Edison visited, we find that their visits caused an increase in bourgeois virtues and patenting. <br> <br> "presented: ASREC 2023 (Harvard), PE Workshop (Harvard)"
