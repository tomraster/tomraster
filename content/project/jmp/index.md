title: "Breaking the ice: The persistent effects of pioneers on trade relationships"
summary: <br> -- <u>Tom Raster</u> <br> <i>Job Market Paper</i> <br> <br> <small> A substantial share of countries and regions today do not trade with each other. An influential hypothesis argues that pioneers, first movers on trade links, are instrumental in lastingly closing these zero trade flows but that they are too few relative to a social optimum due to second movers free-riding on the information they acquire. To what extent does this shortage of pioneers cause zero trade flows? This paper provides the first empirical and causal evidence of the effects of pioneers on trade in the short and long run and through spillovers. I draw on the universe of 1.4 million ship voyages of Baltic Sea ports with the rest of the world from 1500 to 1856. This data allows me to isolate the first pioneering voyage that ever connected two towns and to study how trade evolves subsequently. I obtain quasi-exogenous variation in pioneering from random encounters between captains and from sea ice that temporarily obstructs trade with some towns. I find that an individual pioneering voyage quickly spills over to other captains,  increasing aggregate trade flows by between six and eight %. This effect is composed of (i) increased trade with the pioneered ports, (ii) a lack of diversion from existing ports, and (iii) a wave of further pioneering Tracking captains across their voyages, I find that the 'forced experimentation' induced by sea ice is particularly powerful in lastingly breaking existing trading habits. I also discuss how institutions and captain characteristics impact pioneering success and show that pioneering-induced trade also translates into population growth.</small>
