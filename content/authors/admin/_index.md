Welcome to my website!

I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate (Economics) at the Paris School of Economics under the supervision of Thomas Piketty. In the 2021-22 academic year, I am a visiting student at the Harvard economics department.

My current research focuses on historic trade, migration, and coerced labor in Eastern Europe.
