I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the Paris School of Economics supervised by {{< staticref "http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/en/" "newtab" >}}Thomas Piketty{{< /staticref >}}. 

My research [See Course schedule below](#research) mainly focuses on historic forced labor, trade, and migration involving Eastern Europe. I'm particularly passionate about unlocking and leveraging large-scale archival data.
